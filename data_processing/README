Contains python code used to analyse and prepare the data for model use

Overview (full explanation in documentation):

Data Extractor: reads all JSON files and extracts results data from after match completion
Output: advanced_match_data

Get Features: uses dataset produced by data extractor (advanced_match_data) to generate moving averages for teams stats before each match
Output: teamstats

Overs Extractor: extracts data at the end of each over of each game
Output: match_over_summaries

Merger: combines match_over_summaries with team stats
Output: merged_output

// At this point excel used to improve data visualisation and file saved as NN data 

Cleanser: removes data with empty rows (games before averages have been established), removes over 20 data as game has already finished
Output: NNCleansed20 (final dataset)
